	<h1> My JournalðŸ¤¯</h1>
<p> Journal entry 1: So far, I am liking this class a lot. This class is out of my comfort zone, but I am happy I am trying something new. At first, I was lost and confused but Molly and my classmates were super helpful and now I feel more confident. Something I learned is that with every code, there has to be a sandwich. I also learned how to make a div change when you hover over it.
</p>

<p> Journal entry 2: Feeling like a woman in stem! I got my link to work on my own, which I'm proud of. I also made my person card, with Molly's help. I am starting to feel more confident on Sublime. </p>
