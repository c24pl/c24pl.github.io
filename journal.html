	<h1> My JournalðŸ¤¯</h1>
<p> Journal entry 1: So far, I am liking this class a lot. This class is out of my comfort zone, but I am happy I am trying something new. At first, I was lost and confused but Molly and my classmates were super helpful and now I feel more confident. Something I learned is that with every code, there has to be a sandwich. I also learned how to make a div change when you hover over it.
</p>

<p> Journal entry 2: Feeling like a woman in stem! I got my link to work on my own, which I'm proud of. I also made my person card, with Molly's help. I am starting to feel more confident on Sublime. </p>

<p>Journal entry 3: I am really liking Java Script so far because I feel like I have so many more options and flexibility to do more. I was initally confused, but the tutortials and websites were really helpful. I have learned that attention to detail, and looking over my work is really important.
	</p>

<p> Journal entry 4: I'm really excited we learned how to add audio using Java Script. I have learned that to make clicking odd or even, I put the %2 and then == 0 or 1. Right now, I am having trouble adding my own music to my website, because I downloaded it off of youtube. I used a website that supposedly converts youtube links to mp3, but when I downloaded it and trimmed it on Quick Time, it saves as a m4a. I'm trying to trouble shoot that right now, but over all I am excited about my card and how it's gonna look! </p>

<p> Journal entry 5: I am really happy with my square quilt code because I was able to successfully trouble shoot an issue with the header (thanks to labbing with Molly and talking with other classmates about it). I loved using a combination of both Java Script and CSS in the same code, and I think it is cool how they compliment each other. I liked my square quilt code because it was interactive, but I think I can go further with it, so my next project would be to make a website that is more interactive and uses more of Java Script.
